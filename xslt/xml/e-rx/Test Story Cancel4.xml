    <Description>
        Patient 3 calls his urologist Provider 4. The patient complains of several symptoms: dizziness, somnolence and headaches. Patient 3 was diagnosed with BPH (Benign prostatic hyperplasia) two months ago. The first month, the patient was taking Cardura 1mg once a day and Proscar 5mg once a day. At the last appointment, Provider 4 changed the patientsâ€™ therapy by elevating the dose of Cardura to 2mg once a day. Over the phone, Patient 3 tells the urologist that he has been taking Cardura 2mg once a day, for about two weeks and during that period he experienced the reported symptoms. Provider 4 decides to schedule a new appointment with Patient 3 and advises him to take 1mg of Cardura daily, until the appointment occurs. 
        Provider 4 sends a cancel request for the remaining refills for Cardura 2mg tablets to the patient Pharmacy 2. 
        Pharmacy 2 sends cancel response, indicating that the prescription was transferred to another pharmacy.</Description>
