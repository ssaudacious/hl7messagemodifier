    <Description>
        Patient 8 comes to cardiologist Provider 2 for an appointment. The patients’ primary care physician suspected that Patient 8 has blood pressure-related problems and he referred him to the cardiologist. Cardiologist Provider 2 examines Patient 8 and diagnoses him with hypertension. After performing a thorough history and physical, Provider 2 couldn’t find any cause for the hypertension. To be completely sure of his diagnosis, the doctor schedules some more testing, and, while waiting for the tests to be completed he prescribes Catapres 0.1mg, one tablet twice a day for Patient 8.
        After the patient left the office, cardiologist Provider 2 notices that he prescribed the wrong drug and immediately sends a cancel request for the Catapres 0.1mg order to the Pharmacy 5.
        The pharmacy recognizes Patient 8 and informs the doctor that medication has already been dispensed, and that the 2 refills are canceled.</Description>
