    <Description>
        Patient 5, with a diagnosis of chronic heart failure, is not feeling well. Although he takes his therapy regularly, last few days he has been swelling, feeling nausea, fatigue and shortness of breath. He makes an appointment with his cardiologist Provider 3 to check on his condition and treatment. Due to fluid retention Patient 5 is taking Lasix 40mg, one tablet a day. For preventing hypokalemia, patient is taking Klor-Con 10 mEq extended-release tablets, one tablet two times a day. On the appointment provider decides to run some blood tests. Results showed high levels of creatinine 2.3 mg/dL and potassium levels 5.0 mEq/L. This indicates that patient has kidney failure. For better assessment of patient’s kidney function, Provider 3 orders more testing. Meanwhile, he sends a cancel request for the remaining refills for Klor-con 10 mEq extended-release tablets to the patients’ Pharmacy 1.
        Pharmacy 1 sends a cancel response to Provider 3, informing him that 3 remaining refills for Klor-Con 10 mEq extended-release tablets were successfully canceled.</Description>
