  "teststorydesc" : "A 1 year old male, Tyler Owen Banks, is brought to a clinic for a well child visit. He is accompanied by his father Karl Leonard Banks. Tyler's twin brother, born 5 minutes before Tyler, was not able to make it to the clinic. A clinic staff member collects basic patient demographic information including name, date of birth and sex. A clinic provider, Joe Smith (physician ID 123) reviews the patient's vaccination history and determines that the child requires Hib, Hep A, MMR and Varicella vaccinations. The child is covered by insurance and does not qualify for all Vaccine For Children (VFC) supplied vaccines. The father is given the appropriate Vaccine Information Sheets (VIS) to review. After reading them, the father agrees that the child should receive the Hib, Hep A and MMR vaccines but refuses the Varicella vaccine. He also agrees that the data should be shared once it is incorporated into the local IIS. Appropriate doses of Hib (HIBERIX), Hep A (VAQTA) and MMR (M-M-R II) are selected from the clinic's stock of privately funded vaccines. A clinician, Lily Jackson (ID 456) prepares and administers the doses to the patient and then enters the data into the EHR and transmits it to the IIS.",
